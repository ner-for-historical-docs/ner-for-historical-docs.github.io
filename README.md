## Welcome to NER for Historical Documents!

We are a group of researchers working on [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) in Historical Documents.

We are currently starting this community and plan to :
- organize regular seminars
- collaborate on open-source software

We welcome researchers with the same topic of interest.
